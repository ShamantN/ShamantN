- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShamantN, I have just started my CS engineering, trying to get ahead of the rest by learning more.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and learning how games like valorant,counter strike,fortnite,etc are made. I'm also interested in understanding the working of operating systems like windows, linux, android, iOS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and have a good amount of understanding of it. I have learnt and practiced python in 11th and 12th grade. I have some knowledge in MySQL and using the mysql.connector module in python. I'm hoping to understand where different languages excel and how they can best be used for their respective strong suits.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything i can find right now because i dont know yet how things are done here. Hoping to understand better and be able to contribute with my knowledge as best as i can.
- 📫 How to reach me ... You can reach out to me on my email - shamant999@gmail.com or my Instagram - @shamant_n.
